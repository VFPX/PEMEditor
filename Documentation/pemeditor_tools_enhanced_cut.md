### IDE Tools: Enhanced Cut and Copy

Applies to tools:

*   _Enhanced Cut_
*   _Enhanced Copy_
*   _Enhanced Cut / Additive_
*   _Enhanced Copy / Additive_

These are four closely related tools.

_Enhanced Cut_ and _Enhanced Copy_ work just like normal _Cut_ (Ctrl+X) and _Copy_ (Ctrl+C), except that when there is no selected text, they cut or copy the entire line the cursor is on. 

The _Additive_ variants of _Enhanced Cut_ and _Enhanced Copy_ will add the selected text (or, the entire line, if no text is selected) to the clipboard instead or simply inserting the text into the clipboard.
