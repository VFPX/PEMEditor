### IDE Tools: Favorites

There are three different groups of favorites that you can maintain:

1.  Class Libraries
2.  Classes
3.  Forms

When you are editing a class, you can add that class (and/or class library), as you can see in the example below.  If the class or class library is already in the Favorites list, there will be options available to remove it from the Favorites list. 

Similarly, if you are editing a form, you can add the form to the list, or remove it if it already in the list.

Notes:

*   There is no limit to the number of entries.  This does not guarantee, however, that the popup menu will be able to display all of them!
*   Selecting a class library from the list will open up the class browser.
