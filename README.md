# PEM Editor 7

#### **PEM Editor**: Replacement for the native dialogs to add, edit and maintain properties, events, and methods.

#### **IDE Tools**: A vastly expanded collection of IDE Tools (made accessible by Thor, another VFPx project) that form the backbone for the Thor Repository and the Thor Framework.

_Requires VFP8 or VFP9_  
Version 7.20 Released 2012-08-19

[**<font size="4">What's new in this release</font>**](#WhatsNew)

This release introduces a wide range of new IDE Tools and includes enhancements to those IDE Tools in release 6.10. The concepts for these tools have originated in Visual Studio and other environments, or are due to the originality of a few contributors to the cause.

Each of the tools is documented separately; **[Click here for complete online documentation of IDE Tools](PEM%20Editor%20IDE%20Tools%20Help.html).**

These tools are accessible thru [Thor](https://github/VFPX/Thor) and do not require the existence of the PEM Editor form.

**Download**

PEM Editor 7 with IDE Tools is automatically downloaded and installed by using [One-Click Update of Thor](https://github/VFPX/Thor).

The download can also be downloaded manually from this repository.

To install,

<pre>     Clear All
     Do PEMEditor.APP </pre>

This will not only install PEM Editor, but will also register it so that all of the new IDE Tools are available in Thor.
