Released <!--CVERSIONDATE-->2024-11-15<!--/CVERSIONDATE-->

## Introduction

PEM Editor introduces a wide range of new IDE Tools and includes enhancements to those IDE Tools in release 6.10. The concepts for these tools have originated in Visual Studio and other environments, or are due to the originality of a few contributors to the cause.

Each of the tools is documented separately; **[click here for complete online documentation of IDE Tools](Documentation/pemeditor_ide_tools_help.md).**

These tools are accessible thru [Thor](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor) and do not require the existence of the PEM Editor form.

## Download

PEM Editor 7 with IDE Tools is automatically downloaded and installed by using [Thor Check for Updates](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor/blob/master/Docs/Thor_one-click_update.md).

The download can also be downloaded manually from this repository.

To install,

    Clear All
    Do PEMEditor.APP

This will not only install PEM Editor, but will also register it so that all of the new IDE Tools are available in Thor.
